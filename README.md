# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in JavaScript related to unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments to a function. The `foo` function is designed to handle null values, but the current implementation might not behave as expected in certain edge cases. This repository provides the buggy code, a detailed explanation of the issue, and a corrected solution. 

## Bug Description

The `foo` function includes a check for null values at the beginning and returns early if either `a` or `b` is null. This is intended to prevent errors that might occur with null arguments. However, there might be other parts of the code where the behavior for null is not properly addressed leading to unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The solution involves a more comprehensive approach to handling null values.  All possible scenarios of null values passed to the function are carefully addressed.
